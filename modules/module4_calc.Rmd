```{r chunksetup, include=FALSE} 
# include any code here you don't want to show up in the document,
# e.g. package and dataset loading
library(foreign)
library(fields)
if(!('modules' %in% unlist(strsplit(getwd(), split = '/')))) setwd('modules')
air <- read.csv(file.path('..', 'data', 'airline.csv'), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

# Vectorized calculations

As we've seen, R has many functions that allow you to operate on each element of a vector all at once.

```{r}
vals <- rnorm(1000)
chi2vals <- vals^2
chi2_df1000 <- sum(chi2vals)
# imagine if the code above were a loop, or three separate loops
```

Advantages:

* much faster than looping
* easier to code
* easier to read and understand the code

Sometimes there are surprises in terms of what is fast, as well as tricks for vectorizing things in unexpected ways:
```{r}
vals <- rnorm(1e6)
system.time(trunc <- ifelse(vals > 0, vals, 0))
system.time(vals <- vals * (vals > 0))
```

**Question**: What am I doing with `vals * (vals > 0)` ? What happens behind the scenes in R?

If you use a trick like this, having a comment in your code is a good idea.

Lots of functions in R are vectorized, such as some we've already used.

```{r}
tmp <- as.character(air$DepTime)
air$DepHour <- substring(tmp, 1, 2)
head(air$DepHour)

head(round(strptime(tmp,"%")))
```

Question: Note the code above runs and the syntax is perfectly good R syntax, but in terms of what it does, there is a bug in it. See if you can see what it is.

# Linear algebra 

R can do essentially any linear algebra you need. It uses system-level packages called BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines) and LAPACK (linear algebra package). Note that these calculations will be essentially as fast as if you wrote C code because R just calls C and Fortran routines to do the calculations.

The BLAS that comes with R is fairly slow. It's possible to use a faster BLAS, as well as one that uses multiple cores automatically. This can in some cases give you an order of magnitude speedup if your work involves a lot of matrix manipulations/linear algebra. More details in Module 10.


# Vectorized vector/matrix calculations

Recall that `+`, `-`,`*`, `/` do vectorized calculations:

```{r}
A <- matrix(1:9, 3)
B <- matrix(seq(4,36, by = 4), 3)

A + B
A + B[ , 1]
A * B
A * B[ , 1]
```

Matrix/vector multiplication

```{r}
A %*% B[ , 1]
A %*% B

identical(t(A)%*%A, crossprod(A))
```

Some decompositions

```{r cache=TRUE}
## next 3 lines generate a positive definite matrix
library(fields)
times <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
R <- exp(-rdist(times) / 0.2) # a correlation matrix
######################################################
e <- eigen(R)
range(e$values)
e$vectors[ , 1]

sv <- svd(R)
U <- chol(R)

devs <- rnorm(100)
Rinvb <- solve(R, devs)  # R^{-1} b
Rinv <- solve(R) # R^{-1} -- try to avoid this
```


# Pre-allocation

This is slow.
```{r cache=TRUE}
vals <- 0
n <- 50000
system.time({
for(i in 1:n)
      vals <- c(vals, i)
})
```

The same holds for using `rbind()`, `cbind()`, or adding to a list, one element at a time.

This is both slow and unclear (in the sense that it appears the code has a bug, but it works):
```{r cache=TRUE}
vals <- 0
n <- 50000
system.time({
for(i in 1:n)
      vals[i] <- i
})
```

**Question**: Thoughts on why these are so slow? Think about what R might be doing behind the scenes

# The answer is to pre-allocate memory

This is not so slow. (Please ignore the for-loop hypocrisy and the fact that I could do this as `vals <- 1:n`.)

```{r}
n <- 50000
system.time({
vals <- rep(0, n)
# alternatively: vals <- as.numeric(NA); length(vals) <- n
for(i in 1:n)
      vals[i] <- i
})
```

Here's how to pre-allocate an empty list: 
```{r}
vals <- list(); length(vals) <- n
head(vals)
```

# apply

Some functions aren't vectorized, or you may want to use a function on every row or column of a matrix/data frame, every element of a list, etc.

For this we use the `apply()` family of functions.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(rnorm(100*1000), nr = 100)
row_min <- apply(mat, MARGIN = 1, FUN = min)
col_max <- apply(mat, MARGIN = 2, FUN = max)
```

There are actually some even faster specialized functions:
```{r}
row_mean <- rowMeans(mat)
col_sum <- colSums(mat)
```

# `lapply()` and `sapply()` #sapply() 

```{r}
myList <- list(rnorm(3), rnorm(3), rnorm(5))
lapply(myList, min)
sapply(myList, min)
```

Note that we don't generally want to use `apply()` on a data frame. 

You can use `lapply()` and `sapply()` on regular vectors, such as vectors of indices, which can come in handy, though this is a silly example:
```{r}
sapply(1:10, function(x) x^2)
```

Here's a cool trick to pull off a particular element of a list of lists:

```{r}
params <- list(a = list(mn = 7, sd = 3), b = list(mn = 6,sd = 1), 
  c = list(mn = 2, sd = 1))
sapply(params, "[[", 1)
```

**Challenge**: Think about why this works. 

Hint:
```{r}
test <- list(5, 7, 3)
test[[2]]
# `[[`(test, 2)  # need it commented or R Markdown processing messes it up...

# `+`(3, 7)
```

# And more `apply()`s

There are a bunch of `apply()` variants, as well as parallelized versions of them:

* `tapply()`, `vapply()`, `mapply()`, `rapply()`, `eapply()`
* for parallelized versions see Module 10 or `?clusterApply`

# Tabulation 

- Sometimes we need to do some basic checking for the number of observations or types of observations in our dataset
- To do this quickly and easily, `table()` is our friend
- Let's look at our observations by year and airline

```{r table}
unique(air$UniqueCarrier)
tbl <- table(air$UniqueCarrier, air$Year)
tbl
round(prop.table(tbl, margin = 2), 3)
table(air$UniqueCarrier, air$Month, air$Cancelled)
with(air[air$UniqueCarrier == 'UA', ], table(Month, Cancelled))
```

**Challenge**: Can you figure out what `with()` does just by example? 

# Stratified analyses I
Often we want to do individual analyses within subsets or clusters of our data.

As a first step, we might want to just split our dataset by a stratifying variable.  

```{r, fig.cap ="", fig.width=12}
# restrict to a few destinations
DestSubset <- c('LAX','SEA','PHX','DEN','MSP','JFK','ATL','DFW','IAH', 'ORD') 
airSmall <- subset(air, Dest %in% DestSubset)
airSmall$DepDelay[airSmall$DepDelay > 60] <- 60
subsets <- split(airSmall, airSmall$Dest)
length(subsets)
dim(subsets[['LAX']])
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
boxplot(DepDelay ~ Month, data = subsets[['IAH']], main = 'Houston')
abline(h = 0, col = 'grey')
boxplot(DepDelay ~ Month, data = subsets[['ORD']], main = 'Chicago')
abline(h = 0, col = 'grey')
```

Note the use of the `%in%` operator can also be helpful.

# Stratified analyses II

Often we want to do individual analyses within subsets or clusters of our data. R has a variety of tools for this; for now we'll look at `aggregate()` and `by()`. These are wrappers of `tapply()`. 

```{r aggregate1}
airSmallNum <- airSmall[ , c('DepDelay', 'ArrDelay', 'TaxiIn', 'TaxiOut')]
aggregate(airSmallNum, by = list(destination = airSmall$Dest), FUN = median, na.rm = TRUE)
aggregate(DepDelay ~ Dest, data = airSmall, FUN = median)
agg <- aggregate(DepDelay ~ Dest + Month, data = airSmall, FUN = median)
xtabs(DepDelay ~ ., data = agg)
```

Notice the 'long' vs. 'wide' formats. You'll see more about that sort of thing in Module 6.

# Discretization

You may need to discretize a continuous variable [or a discrete variable with many levels], e.g., by departure delay severity:
```{r fig.width=9}
air$delayStatus <- cut(air$DepDelay, breaks = c(-Inf, -5, 5, 15, 30, 60, 180, Inf))
levels(air$delayStatus) <- c('early','on-time','slight',
                        'short','medium','long','hair-pulling')
tbl <- table(air$UniqueCarrier, air$delayStatus)
round( prop.table(tbl, margin = 1), 2 )
```


# Stratified analyses III

`aggregate()` works fine when the output is univariate, but what about more complicated analyses than computing the median, such as fitting a set of regressions?

```{r}
airSmall$late <- airSmall$DepDelay >= 15
airSmall$Month <- as.factor(airSmall$Month)
airSmall$Month <- relevel(airSmall$Month, "5")
airSmall$Dest <- as.character(airSmall$Dest)

out <- by(airSmall, airSmall$Dest, 
    function(x) {
      if(sum(!is.na(x$late))) 
        # fit logistic regression
        glm(late ~ Month, family = binomial, data = x) 
      else NA
    }
)
length(out)
summary(out[['IAH']])
summary(out[['ORD']])
```

**Question**: What's the business with the `if` statement? Why is this good practice?

# Sorting

`sort()` applied to a vector does what you expect.

Sorting a matrix or dataframe based on one or more columns is a somewhat manual process, but once you get the hang of it, it's not bad.

```{r}
ord <- order(air$DepDelay, air$ArrDelay, decreasing = TRUE)
ord[1:5]
air_ordered <- air[ord, ]
head(air_ordered)
```

You could of course write your own *sort* function that uses `order()`. More in Module 6.

# Merging Data

We often need to combine data across multiple data frames, merging on common fields (i.e., *keys*). In database terminology, this is a *join* operation.

Here's an example where we want to add a column indicating the number of flights to the given destination.

```{r} 
numFlights <- as.data.frame(table(air$Dest))
head(numFlights)

air2 <- merge(air, numFlights, by.x = 'Dest', by.y = 'Var1',
     all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE)
dim(air)
dim(air2)
head(air2)
```

What's the deal with the `all.x` and `all.y` ?  We can tell R whether we want to keep all of the `x` observations, all the `y` observations, or neither, or both, when there may be rows in either of the datasets that don't match the other dataset.

# Breakout

### Basics

1) Create a vector that concatenates the Dest and Origin to create a 'Route' variable in a vectorized way using the string processing functions.
```{r}
air$Route = apply(air[,c("Dest","Origin")], MARGIN = 1, paste,collapse = "-")
```


2) Use `table()` to figure out the number of flights for each year.
```{r}
table(air$Year)
```


### Using the ideas

3) Compute the number of NAs in each column of the *air* dataset using `sapply()` and making use of the `is.na()` function.
```{r}
sapply(air,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

4) Merge the info from data/carriers.csv with the airline dataset so that we have the full names of the airlines as a new column in the data frame.

5) Discretize distance into some bins and create a Dist_binned variable. Count the number of flights in each bin.

```{r}
Dist_binned  = (cut(air$Distance,breaks = c(10,100,300,500,1000,1500,2000,2500,Inf)))
table(Dist_binned )
```

6) Create a boxplot of delay by binned distance.

```{r}
air$Dist_binned  = Dist_binned 
boxplot(DepDelay~Dist_binned,data = air)
```


7) Sort the dataset and find the shortest flight. Now consider the use of `which.min()` and why using that should be much quicker with large datasets.


 
8)  Suppose we have two categorical variables and we conduct a hypothesis test of independence. The chi-square statistic is: 

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{(y_{ij} - e_{ij})^2}{e_{ij}}, 
$$ 

where $e_{ij} = \frac{y_{i\cdot} y_{\cdot j}}{y_{\cdot \cdot}}$, with $y_{i\cdot}$ the sum of the values in the i'th row, $y_{\cdot j}$ the sum of values in the j'th column, and $y_{\cdot\cdot}$ the sum of all the values. Suppose I give you a matrix in R with the $y_{ij}$ values. 

You can generate a test matrix as: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
y <- matrix(sample(1:10, 12, replace = TRUE), 
nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
```

Compute the statistic without *any* loops as follows:

a. First, assume you have the *e* matrix. How do you compute the statistic without loops as a function of `y` and `e`? 
```{r}
apply((y-e)^2/e,MARGIN = c(1,2),FUN = sum)
```

b. How can you construct the *e* matrix? Hint: the numerator of *e* is just an *outer product* for which the `outer()` function can be used.

```{r}
yidot <- rowSums(y)
ydotj <- colSums(y)
e <- outer(yidot, ydotj) / sum(y)
```


### Advanced 

9) For each combination of UniqueCarrier, Month, and DayOfWeek, find the 95th percentile of delay. 
```{r}
aggregate(DepDelay~ UniqueCarrier+Month+DayOfWeek,data = air,FUN = quantile, probs = 0.95, na.rm = TRUE  )
```


10) This requires a bit of setup. Run the following code:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
h <- air$DepTime %/% 100
m <- air$DepTime %% 100
h <- as.character(h)
h[!is.na(h) & nchar(h) == 1] <- paste('0', h[!is.na(h) & nchar(h) == 1], sep = '')
air$DepTimeChar <- paste(h, m, sep = '-')
```

Now suppose the `DepTimeChar` field is the format the departure time field came in.

Create hour and minute fields using `strsplit()` and `sapply()`. What format is the result of `strsplit()`. Why do you need `sapply()`? 
```{r}
air$Hour <- as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(air$DepTimeChar, '-'), '[', 1))
air$Minute <- as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(air$DepTimeChar, '-'), '[', 2))
minutesPerHour <- 60
air$DayMinutes <- (air$Hour-1)*minutesPerHour + air$Minute
hist(air$DayMinutes)
```
